Project Scope:
Create a terminal based Blackjack game for one player, against the 'house'.

Blackjack Rules:

Start with 100 points. 

Draw cards until you reach 21. If your hand is higher than the dealer, you win. 

Hit - take a card
Stand - end turn and stop (does not take a card)
Double - Double wager, take one card, and finish
Split - If two cards are the same, separate to make two hands.
Surrender - give up half-bet and retire from the game.

Number Cards - their numerical value
Face Cards - 10
Ace - 1 or 11 (players choice)


If total exceeds 21 points, it busts -- all bets are lost to the house.


Dealer draws until the hand totals 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all players win.



A player total of 21 on the first two cards is a blackjack and wins immediately, unless the dealer also has one -- this is a tie.
If it's a tie, bets are returned.

Blackjacks are payed 3:2 odds. (Bet + (Bet * (3/2)))

Insurance Bets - If the dealer shows an ace, an insurance bet is allowed. If the dealer has a blackjack insurance pays 2 to 1.
